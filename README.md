## Implemented Algorithms 

The program implements the following algorithms:

### Convex Hull

The Convex Hull problem is implemented using the Graham Scan algorithm and the Jarvis March algorithm.

- Graham Scan: Complexity O(n * log(n))
- Jarvis March: Complexity O(n * h), where n is the number of input points, and h is the number of vertices in the convex hull.

### SSSP Algorithms

For the SSSP, the program provides various algorithms for finding the Shortest Path:

- Dijkstra's Algorithm: Complexity O((V + E) * log(V))
- Single-Source Shortest Path in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG): Complexity O(V + E)
- Bellman-Ford Algorithm with adjacency lists: Complexity O(V^3)
- Bellman-Ford Algorithm with edge list representation: Complexity O(V * E)



### Maximum Flow

To find the Maximum Flow in a flow network, the program implements the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm with Complexity O(F * E), where F is the maximum flow and E is the number of edges.



### Text Pattern Matching

The program uses the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm for text pattern matching with a complexity of O(N + M) where N is the length of the text and M is the length of the pattern.
